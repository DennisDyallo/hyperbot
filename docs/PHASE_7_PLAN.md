### Flow 4: Leverage Change Warning (Existing Position)

**Scenario**: User tries to place order with different leverage than existing position

```
⚠️ Leverage Cannot Be Changed

You have an open BTC position with 3x leverage.

New orders will use the same leverage (3x).

To use 5x leverage:
1. Close current position
2. Set new leverage
3. Open new position

Current Position:
  Size: 0.05 BTC ($4,900)
  Leverage: 3x
  Liquidation: $65,600

Continue with 3x leverage?

💡 Tip: This is a Hyperliquid platform
   limitation, not a bot restriction.

[✅ Yes, Continue] [📊 View Position] [❌ Cancel]

## Enhanced Position Display (NEW)

### Current Problem
**Existing `/positions` command shows:**
- ✅ Coin, side, size, entry price
- ✅ Current price, PnL, leverage
- ❌ **NO liquidation price** (critical missing!)
- ❌ **NO stop loss orders** associated with position
- ❌ **NO risk distance** indicators

**Why This Is Dangerous:**
Traders can't quickly assess:
- "How close am I to liquidation?"
- "Do I have stop loss protection?"
- "Which positions are most at risk?"

### 7. Tutorial Mode / First Time Experience (NEW)
```
🎓 Welcome to Leverage Trading!

This is your first time placing
a leveraged order. Let's learn:

What is Leverage?
Leverage lets you control a larger
position with less capital.

Example:
• Without leverage: $1,000 = $1,000 BTC
• With 5x leverage: $1,000 = $5,000 BTC

⚠️ But remember:
• Profits are multiplied by 5x
• Losses are also multiplied by 5x
• Risk of liquidation exists

[📚 Learn More] [✅ I Understand] [Skip Tutorial]
```

### 8. Order Modification Window (NEW)
```
✅ Limit Order Placed!

Order ID: #12345678
BTC BUY @ $96,530
Size: $1,000

Your order is now active.

⏪ Changed your mind?
   [Cancel Order] (30 sec remaining)

After 30 seconds, use /orders to
manage this order.

[📊 View Orders] [🔙 Main Menu]
```

### 9. Leverage Lock Warning - First Position (NEW)
```
⚠️ Important: Leverage Lock

Once you open this 5x position,
you CANNOT change leverage until
you close the position completely.

Future BTC orders will automatically
use 5x leverage.

This is how Hyperliquid works,
not a bot limitation.

☑️ I understand leverage is locked
   after opening position

[✅ Continue] [📚 Learn More] [❌ Cancel]
```

### 10. Cross Margin Warning (NEW - If Applicable)
```
⚠️ Cross Margin Mode Active

ALL your account balance backs
this position.

Impact:
• Shared margin across all positions
• One liquidation can affect others
• Better capital efficiency
• Higher systemic risk

Alternative: Use isolated margin
to limit risk per position.

**Implementation Priority Rationale**:

1. **7A-7B (Backend/API)**: Foundation must be solid
2. **7C-Lite (Simple Flow)**: Ship fast, validate UX with real users
3. **7D (Positions)**: High-value safety feature
4. **7C-Full (Enhanced)**: Add depth based on feedback
5. **7E-7F (Polish/Launch)**: Final touches and documentation

**Key Change**: Split Phase 7C into 7C-Lite and 7C-Full to enable faster iteration and user feedback

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Complexity in Order Flow
**Impact**: Users confused by too many steps
**Mitigation**:
- Default leverage from settings (skip step if desired)
- Remember last used leverage per coin
- Quick preset buttons (1x, 3x, 5x, 10x)

### Risk 2: Calculation Errors
**Impact**: Wrong liquidation price shown, users get liquidated
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Cross-validate with Hyperliquid API
- Conservative estimates (round down buying power, round up liquidation risk)
- Testnet validation before production

### Risk 3: Performance Impact
**Impact**: Slow order placement due to extra calculations
**Mitigation**:
- Cache account value for 10 seconds
- Async calculation of previews
- Show preview while calculating (progressive loading)

### Risk 4: User Ignores Warnings
**Impact**: Users still place risky trades despite warnings
**Mitigation**:
- Require explicit confirmation for leverage >10x
- Show liquidation scenarios in simple terms
- Add "education mode" that explains risks

## Future Enhancements (Phase 8+)

1. **Smart Leverage Suggestions**
   - ML model suggests optimal leverage based on volatility
   - "Other traders using 3-5x for BTC right now"

2. **Position Size Calculator**
   - "Risk 2% of account on this trade" → auto-calculate size

3. **Leverage Presets per Coin**
   - BTC: Default 3x (less volatile)
   - Altcoins: Default 2x (more volatile)

4. **Margin Usage Charts**
   - Visual timeline of margin usage over time
   - Alerts when approaching dangerous levels

5. **Backtesting**
   - "What if I used 5x instead of 3x last month?"

## UX Design Principles Applied

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
**Problem**: Information overload on mobile screens
**Solution**: Two-tier preview system
- Quick preview (80% use case): Essential info only
- Full details (20% use case): Comprehensive analysis
- Users choose their depth of information

### 2. Mobile-First Design
**Considerations**:
- Telegram primarily used on mobile devices
- Limited screen real estate
- Quick decision-making context
- Thumb-friendly button placement

**Implementation**:
- Quick previews fit in one screen
- Most important info at the top
- Action buttons use clear, specific language
- Loading states prevent perceived lag

### 3. Context-Aware Intelligence
**Examples**:
- Leverage recommendations based on ORDER SIZE, not just generic
- Risk sorting shows dangerous positions first
- Warnings appear only when relevant
- Bulk actions when multiple items need attention

### 4. Scannability
**Techniques**:
- Color coding (🟢🟡🔴) for instant risk assessment
- Grouping (Protected vs. Needs Attention)
- Visual hierarchy with emojis and separators
- Consistent formatting patterns

### 5. Action-Oriented Language
**Instead of**: "Confirm" → **Use**: "Buy $1,000 BTC"
**Instead of**: "Set SL" → **Use**: "Set Stop Loss @ $95k"
**Instead of**: "Continue" → **Use**: "I Understand, Continue"

**Why**: Specific actions reduce cognitive load and prevent errors

### 6. Educational Without Patronizing
**Balance**:
- Tips and helpers available but not forced
- "?" buttons for optional learning
- Tutorial mode for first-timers
- Expert users can skip explanations

### 7. Safety Through Transparency
**Not**: "Don't use high leverage"
**Instead**: Show exact consequences (liquidation price, distance, potential loss)

**Philosophy**: Informed traders make better decisions than restricted ones

### 8. Fail-Safe Defaults
- Default leverage: Conservative (3x)
- Default sort: Risk (most dangerous first)
- Default view: Quick preview (less overwhelming)
- Confirmations required for high-risk actions

### 9. Consistent Mental Models
**Order Flow Pattern** (all order types):
1. Select coin & direction
2. Enter size
3. Choose leverage (same UI every time)
4. See preview (same format every time)
5. Confirm (action-specific button)

**Why**: Muscle memory reduces errors

### 10. Forgiveness
- 30-second undo window for orders
- Edit capabilities for stop losses
- Clear "Back" options at every step
- No dead ends in the UI

## Metrics to Track Post-Launch

### Success Metrics
- **Order Error Rate**: Target <1% (orders placed with wrong leverage/size)
- **Preview Abandonment**: Target <10% (users who see preview but cancel)
- **Stop Loss Coverage**: Target >80% of positions have SL within 24h
- **Time to Place Order**: Target <60 seconds for market orders
- **User Confidence Score**: Survey rating >4.5/5

### Risk Metrics
- **Unexpected Liquidations**: Target 0 (all liquidations had proper warning)
- **Support Tickets**: "I didn't know..." complaints → 0
- **Incorrect Leverage Usage**: Target <5% of orders

### Engagement Metrics
- **Full Preview Usage**: Measure % who expand details
- **Risk Calculator Usage**: Track adoption
- **Tutorial Completion**: % of new users who complete
- **Settings Customization**: % who change default leverage

### Feature Adoption
- **Leverage Selection**: % using inline selection vs. /leverage command
- **Stop Loss Usage**: Before/after comparison
- **Quick Actions**: % using buttons vs. typing commands
- **Buying Power Checks**: /buyingpower command usage
